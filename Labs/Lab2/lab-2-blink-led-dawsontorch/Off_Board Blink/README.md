## Off board Blink

Extracting the G2553 from the board and attaching it to our breadboards was a fairly simple task. Now knowing how to protect this chip without frying it. 
So, in doing so we attached a resistor from power to the reset pin. Along with a small bypass cap to gnd. The code is the same as the multiple blink code we used before, although we had to look at the datasheet to see which pins are connected to what ports.
